Which of the 6 layers surprised you the most in terms of complexity for the product you chose? Why?

For now I am surprised with the LLM selection because every LLM output suggested me to use different LLM so that makes me bit confuse that which one I should select.


What was the single biggest difference you noticed between the LLMs you tested? Not just 'one was better' — what specifically did one do that the others couldn't?

The style of giving response for CHATGPT is far better then other.
